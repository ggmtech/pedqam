# plot Weibull distribution in R.
dweibull(x, shape, scale = 1) #to create the probability density function.
curve(function, from = NULL, to = NULL) #to plot the probability density function.
# Weibull distribution based on parameters shape = 2 and scale = 2 where the x-axis of the plot ranges from 0 to 5:

curve(dweibull(x, shape=2, scale = 2), from=0, to=5,
    main = 'Weibull Distribution (shape = 2, scale = 2)',
    ylab = ' dWeibull gives the density',
    lwd = 2,
    col = 'pink')
    
# Letâ€™s see how to add more than one curve in the same plot
curve(dweibull(x, shape=2, scale = 2), from=0, to=5,
    main = 'Weibull Distribution',
    ylab = ' dWeibull gives the density',
    lwd = 2,
    col = 'pink')
curve(dweibull(x, shape=1.5, scale = 2), from=0, to=5, col='green', add=TRUE)
