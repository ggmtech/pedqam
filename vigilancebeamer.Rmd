> Document established by consensus amongst various stakeholders and provides for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for specific products or services and is aimed at achieving optimum degree of order in a given context. 
These could be specifications, procedures and guidelines to ensure that products, services and systems are safe, consistent and reliable.

- Overall functional requirement of the product
- Who can make it best - myself or other person (vendor)
- Most of the cases, Vendor Detailed specifications in consultation with stakeholders for optimum cost and functionality 
- without costly frills

## RDSO process for New / Change in Standards

Solves about ~ 95% of all company problems 

1. Pareto Chart
2. Run Chart - run-sequence plot
3. Histogram - underlying distribution - process capability
4. Cause-and-effect diagram - Ishikawa fishbone diagram : root causes for an effect into six Ms: measurement, material, machine, method, manpower and mother nature.  Brainstorming "why does this happen?" 
5. Scatter plots : X-Y graph data relationship but no  causation
6. Control charts : processes variation from specs.( x-bar ,  R , S , c , u , np and p chart)
7. Check Sheets : defect concentration diagram, structured forms

Vendors following above likely to have robust internal quality control system

### Vendor supplies performance monitoring: 

- Warranty portal and in future FMM/CMM/WMS in mech deptt 
- Reliability analyses and life tables statistical analysis with censured data 
- Consider Total effective life cycle cost
- Good vendors are assets  and proved values to the business
