If you type the short link on the bottom right of this slide into your browser right now, you'll be able to follow along.

All of these links are clickable from the slides.

Each site was built using R Markdown, with different tools chosen depending on what we needed.

## Why make a course website?


```{r why-site, echo=FALSE}
 knitr::include_graphics("flowery.png")
```



???

Why make a course website at all?  

I think of it as a way first to help me organize my own stuff -- 
to get all my piles of teaching documents into some kind of order.

That makes it more **reproducible** -- for myself and others.

But it is also a way to make me more resilient --
if I'm organized AND online I can be more nimble when changes need to happen.

The side benefit of all this is that it is ALSO more **shareable**, so it makes it easier for learners too b/c they see what I see.

Because we'll be building websites with R Markdown, we'll start by talking about a single file. Desiree - you're up!

# What does an .Rmd look like?

???

Jumping right in, what *does* an R Markdown file look like?

---
class: center, middle

```{r single-rmd, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("flowery.png")
```

???

Here is an r project folder for a lab. 

---
class: center middle

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("flowery.png")
```


???
Inside that folder, you'll notice an RProj file. Opening that file in RStudio takes us...

---
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd.png)
background-size: contain
class: middle, center

???

**here**, where we can see our single R Markdown file. This one is for a lab for visualizing data from the Museum of Modern Art.

Let's quickly walk through some of the key parts of this file.

---
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd0.png)
background-size: contain
class: middle, center

???

It starts with metadata, written in YAML, which is a list of keys on the left and their values on the right.

---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd1.png)
background-size: contain

???

The first key you see is the TITLE, which is `Lab 02: MoMA Museum Tour`.

---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd2.png)
background-size: contain

???

The last YAML section is all about output. Here the output is an html document.


---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd3.png)
background-size: contain

???

Beneath that, we can add options to our html document -- for example, a table of contents, with the key TOC set to TRUE. 

---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd4.png)
background-size: contain

???

So that's the metadata, but the real meat in your R Markdown file 
is text written in markdown...


---
class: middle, center
background-image: url(images/screenshots/Single-rmd5.png)
background-size: contain


???

and your code, written in R.

So these 3 things: metadata, text, and code make up an R Markdown document.

ALISON says:

Of course, Desiree, the real magic happens, when you click on the Knit icon, and see your file turned into HTML. 

So, here's what that looks like: 

- We knit
- We can watch in this bottom pane as our R Markdown document gets processed.
- And voila! -- we see our rendered HTML file. 
- We can choose to open this up in a real browser window.
- And then just test a few things out. 

---

<img src="images/screenshots/Single-knit2.png" style="
  position: absolute; 
  width: 91%; 
  top: -53px;
  right: 5px;
">

???

Using the `THEME:` key in our YAML, we changed our font and colors.

--

<img src="images/screenshots/Single-knit3.png" style="
  position: absolute; 
  width: 97%; 
  top: -45px;
  right: -51px;

And we have this nice table of contents floating off to the side...

--

<img src="images/screenshots/Single-knit4.png" style="
  position: absolute; 
  width: 73%; 
  bottom: 10px;
  right: 80px;
">

???

But this is still local and stuck on my computer. 

A *link* would make it easier to share.

Here is an R Markdown site for a course about data visualization. Actually, the MoMA lab we just turned into a webpage was one of the labs from this course.

└── lab02.Rmd
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("flowery.png")
```

]
???

So let's build a minimal R Markdown site of our own. 

Imagine that this box on the left is the list of files that are inside of our R Project folder. 

---
name: build5

## Build your site

.left-column[

```{r eval=FALSE}
.
├── rstats101.Rproj
├── _site.yml 
├── index.Rmd 
├── schedule.Rmd 
├── lab01.Rmd 
└── lab02.Rmd 
```
]

.right-column[
<img src="images/screenshots/build-site.png" style="margin-top: -28px;">
]

???

To knit all these pages in our R Markdown site, you can mouse over to the Build Tab in RStudio and then click "Build Website".

---
name: build6

## Build your site

.left-column[

```{r eval=FALSE}
.
├── rstats101.Rproj
├── _site/ #<<
├── _site.yml 
├── index.Rmd 
├── schedule.Rmd 
├── lab01.Rmd 
└── lab02.Rmd 
```
]

.right-column[
<img src="images/screenshots/build-site.png" style="margin-top: -28px;">
]

???

Now you can see that it created a new folder called `_site`- that is where our html files live.


---
template: clouds2
class: center top

![](images/screenshots/RMD-site.png)

???

Here is the site we just built. We have a navbar, a theme -- and even a dropdown menu!

Let's look under the hood at some of these files.

---
background-image: url("images/rawpixel/bunch-balloons-rmd1.jpg")
background-position: right
background-size: contain

## .hidden[Inside the `index.Rmd`]

.left-column[

```{r eval=FALSE}
.
├── rstats101.Rproj
├── _site/ 
├── _site.yml
├── index.Rmd #<<
├── schedule.Rmd 
├── lab01.Rmd
└── lab02.Rmd
```
]

???

Let's start with index.Rmd. 

Index is a special file name in any website- because it is the homepage.  

So if each of our R Markdown files in our site was a hot air balloon here, `index` would be the first you would see. 

---
background-image: url(images/Clouds2.jpg)
background-size: cover

## Inside the `index.Rmd`

.left-column[
```{r eval=FALSE}
.
├── rstats101.Rproj
├── _site/ 
├── _site.yml
├── index.Rmd #<<
├── schedule.Rmd 
├── lab01.Rmd
└── lab02.Rmd
```
]

.right-column[
```
---
title: "rstats 101"
---

# Welcome to the course!

This is the course website...
```
]


???

If we take a peek inside index.Rmd, we don't see anything special-

in fact, you can take *any* existing R Markdown document that you already have, rename it `index`, and turn it into your site's homepage.



---
background-image: url("images/rawpixel/bunch-balloons-rmd2.jpg")
background-position: right
background-size: contain


## .hidden[Inside the `_site.yml`]

.left-column[
```{r eval=FALSE}
.
├── rstats101.Rproj
├── _site/ 
├── _site.yml #<<
├── index.Rmd 
├── schedule.Rmd 
├── lab01.Rmd
└── lab02.Rmd
```
]

???

The `_site.yml` is new. 

This is the file that ties all the pages together.

It is called the site configuration file, written in YAML.

Let's take a look inside...

---
background-image: url(images/Clouds2.jpg)
background-size: cover

## Inside the `_site.yml`

.left-column1[

```{r echo=FALSE}
yml_empty() %>%
  yml_navbar(
    title = "rstats101",
    left = list(
      navbar_page("Schedule", href = "schedule.html"),
      navbar_page("Labs", 
                  menu = list(
                    navbar_page("Lab 1", href = "lab01.html"),
                    navbar_page("Lab 2", href = "lab02.html")
                    )
                  )
      )) %>% 
  yml_output(html_document(theme = "flatly")) %>% 
  asis_yaml_output(fences = FALSE)
```
]

.right-column1[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("flowery.png")
```
]


???

The first thing you may notice is this is a YAML file, so there are no fences, but it is a list of keys and values.

The first key is `navbar:`, and this is how you build your site's navigation.

--
<img src="images/screenshots/RMD-site-title.png" style="
  position: absolute;
  width: 64%;
  top: 135px;
  right: 6px;">
  
???
there is key for the title... 

--

<img src="images/screenshots/RMD-site-left.png" style="
  position: absolute;
  width: 64%;
  top: 135px;
  right: 6px;">

???

Whether we want links on the left or right... 

--

<img src="images/screenshots/RMD-site-menu.png" style="
  position: absolute;
  width:64%;
  top: 135px;
  right: 6px;">

???

And if we want links listed in a dropdown menu, we can do that too... 

--

???

For all the pages you link to in your navbar, the `href:` needs to point to an .html file, even though the source may be R Markdown.

Finally, we set up a theme that applies to the navbar and all pages.

For all the pages you link to in your navbar, the `href:` needs to point to an .html file, even though the source may be R Markdown.

As for the other R Markdown pages, there is nothing special about them. 

As long as you link to a page in `_site.yml`, you can take any existing R Markdown file and turn it into a page within a website.

Good job, Alison!

That is exactly what we see. You can set the YAML for each page if you want.

If you wanted these output options on every page in your site, we could have added these to the `_site.yml` instead.

Okay, we're finally, ready to share our R Markdown site -- we'll do this the same way as before. All of our HTML, website-ready pages are stored in the _site/ folder. So This this is the only folder, we need to ddrag and drop

unclaimed sites are deleted after 24 hours. We have to create an account with Netlify to keep our site online permanently.

So let's go back to Netlify and do that.

If you already use GitHub or BitBucket, then I recommend you use that to sign in becuase you're workflow will be smoother if your accounts are connected. But for today, I'm just going to sign up with email...

Once you've signed up, you'll see you have an account dashboard. And your silly-named link is now here to stay.

Once we've re-built our site wiith the changes we want. We'll go back to our _site/ folder. 

In netlify, we can make sure we are in the "deploy" tab of our dashboard -- and there's a spot specifically for updating. WE can drag and drop again here. 

We click on the link--and see our new theme has been applied.

### The good

### The bad

* No Subfolders

]

???

Some great thing about R Markdown sites:

You don't have to change much from your original docs. 
You get to use built in themes

One not to great thing is that you can't use subfolders -- which means you can end up with a lot of files in your directory. That can get messy, but that's how it is.


With those points in mind, let's move on to our next tool.

???

This is a distill website.

The style is not easy to change without CSS, but it looks pretty slick out-of-the-box.

Think of distill as the nerdier sibling of an R Markdown site- it is built for technical and scientific communication. 

For example...

class: middle, center
template: clouds2

???

So now let's build a minimal Distill site of our own. 

Just like we did with the R Markdown site, we use the build tab to knit all our files at once.

This creates a `_site` folder for our HTML files.

Quick things to notice -- let's look inside.

???

The index page in a distill site will work just the same as in an R Markdown site. 

It will be the site's home page. 

Any existing R Markdown document you have will do.

But there is one addition we make inside of this file.

`site: distill::distill_website` should be added to the YAML.

Including a title and short description is nice too. 

[*note*: `site: distill::website` is only necessary if you wanna make the blog later]

The output **must** specify that this is a Distill article.

Part of your Distill site can be in a blog format!

You can have a single page made up of clickable posts, like this.
Each post is itself its own page, and it doesn't need to be built into the navigation bar.

├── project.Rmd 
└── schedule.Rmd #<<

```

]

.right-column[
```
---
title: Schedule
listing: posts
---
```
]

???

Instead, we create a listing page -- an R Markdown document whose only job is to have a title and a listing YAML key and value.

We'll call our "schedule".

## Update the `_site.yml`

.left-column[
```{r eval=FALSE}

├── lab1.Rmd

├── project.Rmd 
└── schedule.Rmd
```

]

.right-column[
```{r eval = FALSE}
title: Data Viz
navbar:
  right:
    - text: Labs
      menu:

      - text: Lab 2
        href: lab02.html
    - text: Project
      menu: project.html
    - text: Schedule #<<
      menu: schedule.html #<<
output: distill::distill_article
```
]

???

Then, we link our listing page to navigation bar.

Now we are ready to make some posts.

---
background-image: url(images/Clouds2.jpg)

## Create a post

.pull-left[
```{r eval=FALSE}

├── index.Rmd
├── Project1.Rmd 
├── Project2.Rmd
└── _posts/ #<<
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
distill::create_post("Week1")
```
]

???

In your console, run the `distill::create_post( )` function, and give your post a title in quotes. 

This will make a new folder called `posts/`, a sub-directory for your new post, and it will open up a new R Markdown file for you to edit.

You can rinse and repeat -- creating as many new posts as you'd like. 

Let's look inside one.

---
background-image: url(images/Clouds2.jpg)
background-size: cover

## Inside a post

.left-column[
```{r eval=FALSE}

]

.right-column[
```
---
title: Week 1
date: 03-24-2020
output: distill::distill_article
---

During our first week we will 
make our first plots with `ggplot2`.
```
]

???

(You can see on the left what I mean by the sub-directory for your post.)

On the right, we see the YAML of your new post will be automatically populated with the appropriate keys, but you can edit them if you'd like.

Now you can paste in the body content of any existing R Markdown file into your post, **knit**, and you'll be good to go. 

Unfortunately, each posts **does** have to be knit individually.

```
]

.right-column[
