## Performance  2015-16 vs 2016-17


### Comparative  Performance apr-Aug  - 2016 vs 2017



# Action taken for Reliability and safety

  -	Formulation & Monitoring of Action plan targets for Diesel sheds issued by CEE for 2017-18
  - Planning of Major & Medium schedules for 2017-18 & Compliance of Major & Medium schedules
  - Timely implementation of various Drives  such as 
      + Summer Drives, 
      + Fire prevention Drive, 
      + Safety Drives & 
      + Engine shut down 
      + prevention check Drive.
  - Award of AMCs on OEM of MBCS,MCBG & TCCs and other subassemblies

# Good Works Done in recent past

  - Cleanliness drive conducted in all sheds and regularly being organised
  - NR Diesel Wing has finalized the condemnation of 71 overage & 24 premature obsolete   and  Accidental locos during 2016-17. 21 locos are further under process of condemnation.

  - All ALCO and HHP locos at NR based sheds have been completed for the modification of provision of additional BP cut out cocks with vent. Provision of additional BP cut out cocks with vent will discharge the air much faster (BP destruction). This modification was done as per RDSO letter no. SD.DFM.A.4.7 dated:26.03.15.

# auto page brake ? how

  -	All four diesel sheds of NR (TKD, AMV, SSB and LDH) are IMS certified diesel sheds
  - WDG4 Locomotives maintenance has been started at LDH shed w.e.f. 01.12.16. Currently 13 WDG4 locomotives are based at LDH Diesel Loco shed.  With this facility creation, HHP loco maintenance facility is available at all the three major sheds of NR viz TKD, AMV and LDH. This will add flexibility to train operations and will help in liquidating the overdue schedules of HHP locomotives at shortest possible ineffective over NR by minimising Dead Loco movements of HHP locos.

  - Provision of CCTV in DTC exam hall at Diesel shed AMV in terms of directions of Railway board and CCTV in Stores Depot have also been provided for security and vigil.
???	A Motorised Truck Assembly has been prepared for WDM3A locos in Diesel shed TKD as a unit exchange item for improving reliability and performance of the asset. 
  - Skill development Programme - In an effort of upgrading skill and knowledge dissemination to shed staff, practical training sessions by expert supervisors have been started in all sheds. For adopting good practice of other Railways??? sheds visits of staff done.
  - Steps taken for human resources development
  - Grievance Cells are functioning in all sheds
  - Promotions for technicians staff finalised at TKD last year. This was pending since last many years.
  - Indents for filling up of vacancies sent to RRBs.
  - A cell for retired staff has been started at TKD shed to resolve their problems and assist in getting Railway passes etc.
  - RO water is available in all sheds for drinking to all shed staff.
  - Inputs in canteens has been given to improve infrastructure and quality of food.
