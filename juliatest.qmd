```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(JuliaCall)
## This is a R language chunk.
## In the previous julia chunk, we define variable a,
## we can use functions in JuliaCall to get access to it.
julia_eval("a")
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
