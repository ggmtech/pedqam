## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# simplified Cause effect Diagram # Create the cause-and-effect diagram
SixSigma::ss.ceDiag( "Cause To Explaint",
                     
                      c("Personnel", "Weather", "Suppliers", "Planning", "testingdata"),
                      
                      c(  c("Training", "Inadequate"), 
                          c("Rain", "Temperature", "Wind"), 
                          c("Materials", "Delays", "Rework"), 
                          c("Customer", "Permissions", "Errors"), 
                          c("evenwithoutit", "Permissions", "Errors") 
                        ),
                        
                      main = "Cause-and-Effect Diagram with SixSigma package)",
                      sub = "capyion Construction Example"
                     )
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
