This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook.  
When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by  *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
