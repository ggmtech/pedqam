\section{History of the case}\label{history-of-the-case}}

Based on a complaint by M/s Prag industries , Lucknow to Member(RS)
Railway Board, and PED/Vigilance , Railway Board , etc, the case was
investigated and Vigilance organisation recommended following system
improvements.

\begin{quote}
Whenever a new specification or a revision of specification is proposed
in future by the wagons directorate , the costing of the final / new
product along with the other financial implications involves should be
worked out beforehand by the dte with concurrence of Finance dte of RDSO
and the same may be advised to Zonal Railways under the approval of
rly.Bd.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
CVO view that indicative costing of the items should be done by
concerned directorate with finance vetting by invoking book examination
clause, if need be,, as a result of discrete value analysis to preclude
the possibility of revenue loss. It is also hightime where RDSO may
consider setting up of value analysis cell for this purpose,
\end{quote}

DG directed setting up of a committee of 3 PED's to examine the
recommended system improvement to examine the recommended system
improvement at para ``e'' / NP3 , which is reproduced as :

\begin{quote}
Whenever a \emph{new specification} or a \emph{revision of
specification} is proposed in future by the wagons directorate , the
costing of the final / new product along with the other financial
implications involves should be worked out beforehand by the dte with
\emph{concurrence of Finance dte of RDSO} and the same may be advised to
Zonal Railways under the approval of rly.Bd.
\end{quote}

Accordingly, the committee of the following officers has been nominated
by Spl.DG/VD vide confidential note Ref.No.DG(Spl.)/VD/Vigilance dated
15.09.2021

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Gopal Kumar, PED/QA(Mech) - Convener
\item
  Sunit Kumar, PED(EL)
\item
  Alok Mathur, PED/QA(Elec)
\end{itemize}

The committee has also gone through the case file RDSO/20/Vig/05/CT/39
sent along with the nomination of the committee. It is also noted that
then then DG/RDSO had also already princiapally agreed with the
recommendations for working out financial implications, including
financial vetting of the costing at NP4 of the file RDSO/20/Vig/05/CT/39
and the costing is thus essentially required to be worked out by RDSO.

\hypertarget{deliberations-of-committee}{%
\section{Deliberations of committee}\label{deliberations-of-committee}}

Committee discussed the issue and also invited suggestions from the
vendor dealing directorates in the WA group.

Committee examined the various methods for estimating the cost in the
existing codes and practices.

\subsection{Estimation of manufacturing cost as per IR Rolling Stock
Code:}\label{estimation-of-manufacturing-cost-as-per-ir-rolling-stock-code}}

Since, the costing has to be vetted, the finance is likely to vet
against the standard policy issued in this regard. One such source is
Indian Railway Rolling Stock code which has a chapter on the costing of
Indian Railway workshop manufactured item - job costing system as
explained in para 603 onwards.

\url{https://indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/codesmanual/MechDept/Final_6_DME.PDF}
para 603 Job Costing System, (For Shop manufactured items),

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{604}
\tightlist
\item
  Features of Job Costing System a For each item of manufacture there is
  Allowed time against each process of work. b Standard quantity of raw
  material to be drawn with the specification is also given. c The unit
  cost of manufacture is arrived from cost sheet for the particular work
  order wherein, all elements of cost are charged to that work order. d
  Total cost divided by the quantity completed for that work order will
  give the unit cost of item manufactured. e The standard fixed helps
  comparison of unit cost with other shops or with trade cost.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

This process does not appear feasible in RDSO as this process requires a
detailed set up of production , planning and control with time studies
and working out of overheads as per the codes. In the current industrial
scenarios, the production of Railway items is not generally planned as a
sole production line but as a flexible manufacturing system and it would
be difficult to attribute the overhead costs and costing is likely to be
based on business decision of the company and the competitive
environment of the industry.

Manual for Procurement of Goods 2017 Ministry of Finance 16 Chapter -- 2
Need assessment, formulation of Specifications and Procurement Planning

The following is the para on the estimation of cost:

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  Estimation of Cost:
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The estimated cost in the indent is a vital element in various
  procurement processes, approvals and establishing reasonableness of
  prices at the time of evaluation of the bids. Therefore, it should be
  worked out in a realistic and objective manner. The prevailing market
  price ascertained through a market survey or budgetary quotations from
  one or more prospective suppliers or published catalogues/Maximum
  Retail Price (MRP) printed on the item is the main source for
  establishing the estimated cost of items for which there no historic
  data available. It may be noted that MRPs usually include significant
  margins for distributors, wholesalers and retailers;
\item
  For equipment/craft which are uniquely custom-built to buyer's
  specifications, the best way to get a fair assessment of costs is by
  obtaining budgetary quotes from potential parties. Ideally, there
  should be three quotes. However, there is need to have a time schedule
  for receipt of quotes to ensure some timeframe for this activity.
  Thus:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    An attempt should be made to obtain as many budgetary quotes as
    possible from reputed/potential firms and a time of 21 (twenty-one)
    days be indicated therefore. In the event of receipt of less than
    three budgetary quotes, two extensions of up to 10 (ten) days each
    may be considered; and
  \item
    In the event of non-availability of three quotes within the above
    extended period, the estimates should be prepared on the basis of
    the number of budgetary quote(s) received, which may even be one;
    and where more than one budgetary quote is received, the estimate
    should be framed on an average of the quotes which will reduce
    variations and fluctuations;
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  In addition, wherever they are available Directorate General of
  Supplies and Disposals (DGS\&D) rates should be considered. Likewise
  rates should be compared with recent orders/purchases of similar
  equipment by other states/ Departments. Other methods for establishing
  the estimated cost in the indent and tender evaluation are:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Estimated rate in past indents of the same goods;
  \item
    Last purchase price of this or similar or nearly equivalent
    requirements;
  \item
    Costing analysis based on costs of various components/raw materials
    of the item;
  \item
    Rough assessment from the price of the assembly/machine of which the
    item is a part or vice versa;
  \item
    Through the internal or external expert costing agencies; and
  \item
    As a last resort, rough assessment from the opportunity cost of not
    using this item at all;
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii})}
  \setcounter{enumii}{3}
  \item
    These methods are not mutually exclusive and can be supplemented
    with escalations to cater for inflation, price increases of raw
    materials, labour, energy, statutory changes, price indices, and so
    on, to make them usable in conditions prevailing currently. In case
    of foreign currencies, the rate should be reduced to a common
    denomination of Indian Rupees. Price indices can be obtained from
    the following websites. Some may require prior free registration and
    some paid subscription:

RDSO has no role in deciding the cost of the item. It has to be
justified by the TEC which is the basic function of TEC.

\emph{RDSO however can provide information which may be available at the
best effort basis without involving in protracted correspondence from
field offices , as this would lead wastage of limited resource available
with RDSO as RDSO has not been able to delver any substantial good due
to such wastage of resources.}

costing can be done by establishing the following capacities in the RDSO
if the same is inescapably required.

The committee is aware that even BIS is not doing any costing for their
standards/ specifications. Now RDSO is also a standards making body
approved by BIS.

Costing may be required : - During product development - During review (
taking consequential / subsequent financial implications) and - product
development stage - To check overpricing of RDSO controlled item.

Registration of the supplier should be done following a fair,
transparent and reasonable procedure and after giving due publicity.
(ii) Credentials, manufacturing capability, quality control systems,
past performance, after-sales service, financial background etc. of the
supplier(s)should be carefully verified before registration. (iii) The
supplier(s)will be registered for a fixed period (between 1 to 3 years)
depending on the nature of the goods. At the end of this period, the
registered supplier(s) willing to continue with registration are to
apply afresh for renewal of registration. New supplier(s)may also be
considered for registration at any time, provided they fulfil all the
required conditions. (iv) Performance and conduct of every registered
supplier is to be watched by the concerned Ministry Deportment. The
registered supplier(s)are liable to be removed from the list of approved
suppliers if they fail to abide by the terms and conditions of the
registration or fail to supply the goods on time or supply substandard
goods or make any false declaration to any Government Agency for any
ground which, in the opinion of the Government,is not in public
interest. (v) The list of registered suppliers for the subject matter of
procurement be exhibited on the Central Public ProcurementPortaland
websites of the Procuring Entity/ e-Procurementl portals.
