EC1- Work Integrated Learning Exercise (WILe)

AE ZG 612/ DM ZG 612 - Advances in Materials, Composites and Plastics

Date: 13/02/2020		Duration: 4 Weeks			Total marks: 20

    1. Assumptions made if any, should be stated clearly at the beginning of your report.
    2. This exercise can be attempted individually or in a group.
    
# The owl blessings

the out.width and out.height arguments can be used with any type of graphic and conveniently can accept sizes in pixels or percentages as a string with % or px as a suffix.  fig.retina = 2, dpi= 300,

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "The owl blessings", fig.width=1.5, fig.height=1.5, out.width = '40%',  out.height = '40%', dpi= 300, cache=TRUE}
library(bookdown)
library(png)
library(jpeg)
knitr::include_graphics("flowery.png")
```

one option was 
include graphics b y path,   auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", FALSE),   dpi = NULL,   error = TRUE

<center>

![your image caption](flowery.png)

</center>

**For clickable link**
 
[![your image caption](flowery.png)](www.google.com)


## multiple images

Add multiple images at a time

The path argument in include_graphics will accept a vector of names. If you have a folder of images and want to add all them to your document at the same time simply point to the folder and voila!

```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="30%"}
myimages<-list.files("./", pattern = ".png", full.names = TRUE)
knitr::include_graphics(myimages)
```



```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="5%"}
myimages<-list.files("./", pattern = ".png", full.names = TRUE)
knitr::include_graphics( rep((myimages), 4)  )

knitr::include_graphics(rep("flowery.png", 10))


#knitr::include_graphics(rep("flowery.png", 3))
```

Load an image from a URL

Super easy – point to an image on the web.

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
#knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/MC_Drei-Finger-Faultier.jpg/330px-MC_Drei-Finger-Faultier.jpg")

#knitr::include_graphics("http://pngimg.com/uploads/bouquet/bouquet_PNG62.png")
```


# fig caption
useing package library(captioner) and use fig.caps = nameofcaptiongiven = "iris" hare

Now you can create your first caption:
 table_nums (name = "iris", caption = "Edgar Anderson's iris data.  All measurements are in centimetres.")

Add an horizontal line by adding 3 stars:

## Problem Statement:

> Select any one of the two problem statements from below.
                1. Consider a large system consisting of 10 or more parts from your workplace or around and dissect it into its constituent components. Using various destructive and non-destructive techniques identify the material constituent each part is made of. Explore the reason for the specific material used for a part/component. Also identify the manufacturing process used for each part.

>                 2. Select 5 different forged/cast components from your workplace or around that has failed/fractured during test or service and identify their application and possible failure mode (brittle/ductile/torsion/fatigue/creep etc.) for each component. Relate the observed failure mechanism to the possible cause of failure and list out possible mitigation method for each part/component.

> Approach: 
    • Observation
    • Application of knowledge acquired
    • Use of necessary and available tools
    • Peer discussion

## Report: 

A 2-3  pages report shall be submitted that includes problem statement, methodology, identified system and analysis etc. All the necessary photographs/videos shall be shared in a presentable format preferably a video presentation (not more than 10 minutes).  

## Due date for Submission: March 16, 2020



Support _italic_ aka *em* and **strong**,  `code` snippets.


# Introduction

The Tufte handout style is a style that Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufte's style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography. 
See footnote^[See Github repositories [tufte-latex](https://github.com/tufte-latex/tufte-latex) and [**mygithubrepository**](https://github.com/ggmtech].

You may use `tufte_handout` format for handouts, and `tufte_book` for books, `tufte_html` for html. 
See the book  @R-rmarkdown.

```yaml

title: "An Example Using the Tufte Style"
author: "John Smith"
output:
  tufte::tufte_handout: default
  tufte::tufte_html: default

```

There are two goals of this package:

1. To produce both PDF and HTML output with similar styles from the same R Markdown document;
1. To provide simple syntax to write elements of the Tufte style such as side notes and margin figures

For margin figure use `fig.margin = TRUE` unlike `\begin{marginfigure} \end{marginfigure}` 
or `<span class="marginfigure"> </span>`; .


# Headings


# Figures

## Margin Figures

chunk option `fig.margin = TRUE`. For example:

```{r fig-margin, fig.margin = TRUE, fig.cap = "MPG vs hp, color by transmission.", fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, cache=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
mtcars2 <- mtcars
mtcars2$am <- factor( mtcars$am, labels = c('automatic', 'manual')  )
ggplot(mtcars2, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +
              geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
              theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

The `fig.cap` chunk option to provide a figure caption. 

## Arbitrary Margin Content

In fact, you can include anything in the margin using the **knitr** engine named `marginfigure`. 
Unlike R code chunks ```` ```{r} ````, you write a chunk starting with ```` ```{marginfigure} ```` instead, then put the content in the chunk. See an example on the right about the first fundamental theorem of calculus.

{marginfigure}  This margin figure not recognised and other not compiled

We know from _the first fundamental theorem of calculus_ that for $x$ in $[a, b]$:

$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$$


keep the margin content as simple as possible (syntax-wise) in the `marginefigure` blocks for html pdf interchang.  refrain from using footnotes, citations, or block-level elements (e.g. blockquotes and lists) there.

## Full Width Figures

chunk option `fig.fullwidth = TRUE`.

```{r fig-fullwidth, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 2, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.cap = "A full width figure.", warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(~ cut)
```

Usually `fig.width` is large and `fig.height` is small. In the above example, the plot size is $10 \times 2$.

## Main Column Figures

Figures constrained to the main column is the default for LaTeX/HTML output.

```{r fig-main, fig.cap = "A figure in the main column.", cache=TRUE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut, price)) + geom_boxplot()
```

# Sidenotes

 Any  footnote will automatically converted to a sidenote^[Footnote on sidenote as default] 


# References

cite R here [@R-base]. To enable this feature, you must set `link-citations: yes` in the YAML metadata



To check the version of `pandoc-citeproc` in your system, you may run this in R:

```{r eval=FALSE}
system2('pandoc-citeproc', '--version')
```

If your version of `pandoc-citeproc` is too low, or you did not set `link-citations: yes` in YAML, references in the HTML output will be placed at the end of the output document.

# Tables

Use with `kable()` . The table captions are placed in the margin like figures in the HTML output.

```{r}
knitr::kable( mtcars[1:6, 1:6], caption = 'A subset of mtcars.' )
```

# Block Quotes

Start with `>` are converted to block quotes. 
To right-aligned footer for the quote, you may use the function `quote_footer()` eg

> "If it weren't for my lawyer, I'd still be in prison. It went a lot faster with two people digging."
>
> `r tint::quote_footer('--- Joe Martin')`



# More Examples

Two plots in one figure environment with the chunk option `fig.show = 'hold'`:

```{r fig-two-together, fig.cap="Two plots in one figure environment.", fig.show='hold', cache=TRUE}
p <- ggplot(mtcars2, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +
  geom_point()
p
p + geom_smooth()
```

Then two plots in separate figure environments (the code is identical but the chunk option is the default `fig.show = 'asis'` now):

```{r fig-two-separate, ref.label='fig-two-together', fig.cap=sprintf("Two plots in separate figure environments (the %s plot).", c("first", "second")), cache=TRUE}
```

The two figures have different captions, and that is because we used a character vector of length 2 for the chunk option `fig.cap` (something like `fig.cap = c('first plot', 'second plot')`).

Mltiple plots in margin figures with two plots in the same figure environment in the margin:

```{r fig-margin-together, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Two plots in one figure environment in the margin.", fig.width=3.5, fig.height=2.5, cache=TRUE}
p
p + geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

Then two plots from the same code chunk placed in different figure environments:

```{r fig-margin-separate, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap=sprintf("Two plots in separate figure environments in the margin (the %s plot).", c("first", "second")), fig.width=3.5, fig.height=2.5, cache=TRUE}
knitr::kable(head(iris, 15))
p
knitr::kable(head(iris, 12))
p + geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
knitr::kable(head(iris, 5))
```

We blended some tables in the above code chunk only as _placeholders_ to make sure there is enough vertical space else they will be stacked tightly together. 

figures with no captions below in the margin, in the main column, and in full width, respectively.

```{r fig-nocap-margin, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=2, cache=TRUE}
# a boxplot of weight vs transmission; this figure
# will be placed in the margin
ggplot(mtcars2, aes(am, wt)) + geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()
```
```{r fig-nocap-main, cache=TRUE}
# a figure in the main column
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, hp)) + geom_point()
p
```
```{r fig-nocap-fullwidth, fig.fullwidth=TRUE, fig.width=10, fig.height=3, cache=TRUE}
# a fullwidth figure
p + geom_smooth(method = 'lm') + facet_grid(~ gear)
```

# Some Notes on Tufte CSS


For epigraphs,use a pair of underscores to make the paragraph italic in a block quote, e.g.

> _I can win an argument on any topic, against any opponent. People know this, and steer clear of me at parties. Often, as a sign of their great respect, they don't even invite me._
