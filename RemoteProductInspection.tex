\section{1. Introduction}\label{introduction}}

1.1. As per the directions contained in the letter dated 19 Jan 2021 ,
possibility of usage of remote product inspection has been examined.
RDSO specifically deals with Safety and critical items and this calls
for high quality of inspection. The committee has tried to make an
initial Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for remote product inspection
to facilitate ease of remote inspection and also to cover the quality
and reliability of the products inspected and attested for quality by
RDSO inspectors. Initially 20 items have been identified and based on on
the experience and feedback from the Railways, the system shall again be
reviewed after six months for assessing continuance or extending the
system to cover more items.

During the unprecedented COVID19 lockdown extraordinary situation, RDSO
has devised a remote vendor registration capability assessment, remote
audit and remote product inspection. This process was actually utilised
in 9 cases in RDSO during the peak of covid19 and remote quality audit
has now been extended in normal time vide Spl. DG /VD directions in
letter date \ldots.

1.2. Spl DG VD has formed a committee of PED/PS, PED/QAM \& PED/S\&T to
propose a Standard Operating Procedure for remote inspection of Products
and also identify the RDSO inspected items which could be taken up
during the first phase and based on the field experience the same could
be reviewed or extended to other items.

1.3. The matter has been deliberated in various meetings of the
Committee Members. Details of discussions and recommendations are as
under:

\hypertarget{discussions}{%
\section{2. Discussions}\label{discussions}}

2.1 Presently the process of the RDSO inspection involves the following
process. ( ISO Document \ldots{} )

2.2.1 The RDSO approved vendor based on the Railway PO, places an online
call in the RDSO product inspection module. The system automatically
assignees the Quality inspector for the inspection. The inspector
physically schedule the visit to the manufactures approved units and
carries out the inspection as per the Check list downloaded from the
RDSO website.

2.2.2. The Inspector after the inspection also identifies the items with
the unique serialised holographic stickers.

2.2.3 Visit for Inspection , if applicable for the particular item, is
also needed to be made at Officer/Inspecting official (SSE/JE) level. (
ISO Document No.~\ldots.)

2.2.3 The inspecting official, based upon the result of the inspection ,
issues the dispatch memo on the spot digitally signed. Based on the
dispatch memo verification, the inspection official of RDSO at gazetted
level issues the Inspection Certificate digitally signed in the online
ireps portal in transparent manner and which is immediately available to
all concerned parties for acceptance and accountal and associated
payments.

2.11 The above process needs to be modified with a suitable SOP for
handling RDSO inspections done via online mode.

  preferably cloud storage from Railway PSU like RailTel Servers running
  HDFS network storage with at least industry standard 3 tier
  replication of data. A compressed recording storage space of about 5-6
  hours may be required for each inspector for per day of inspection.
  This needs to be operated through a secure portal to store and access
  the digitally stored inspection data on need to know basis.
\item
  GPS and Time stamping of the images / Videos and automatic generation
  of strong secure hashes for data integrity.
\item
  In future to keep RDSO in the forefront of technology, image analytic
  could be developed by RailTel to analyse to process the images to
  extract the dimensions and features of the images.

\section{5. Proposed action plan for Online Remote Inspection by
RDSO}\label{proposed-action-plan-for-online-remote-inspection-by-rdso}}

Initially, few RDSO controlled items , which are least critical items
and also amenable for remote inspection shall be selected and based on
the experience gained and the feedback from the Railway, the system
shall be reviewed after say six months.

The committee deliberated various issues related to commercial/legal
aspects and the technical process capabilities of the Remote Inspection
Protocol and also informally gathered information from the similar
government agencies.

In view of the mandated directive, and also considering the fact that
RDSO controlled items by definition are ``Safety and Critical items''
and therefore it is proposed that initially the RDSO shall decide few
prima facie amenable items ( Annexure:List of Items) and proceed for the
remote inspection based on the initial draft ``Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP)'' as attached as annexure (Annexure:SOP).

Based on experience gained for a period of about 6 months and based on
the feed back from various stockholders including the Vendors and Field
Railways, this procedure shall needs to be reviewed again to extend to
other items.

Committee also notes that unlike RDSO , agencies like RITES etc are more
amenable and can be mandated by Board to adopt online Inspections only
so that trier experience can be extended to RDSO safety items also.

\item
  The background of the process psychologically mislead the reality.
  This is a proven pitfall and Inspection will be affected with his

  example photos are included in the annexure.
\item
  The vendor will have tendency to set up biased measurement /recording
  workstations.
\item
  An important ability of locating the faults and system shortcomings on
  a quick glance of rejections and scrap would be lost.

The committee also highlights that the process of getting material on
Internal Test Report and vendors certificate is better then attesting
the claims of the vendor quality by remote procedure.

However the advantage is that all the data on which inspection was based
exists in the records and the vendor continues to be responsible for the
quality at least till his warranty period. In case of digital
inspection, it is proposed that warranty period could be increased
suitably. Further, in future digital analytic can be used for completely
automating the inspections.
